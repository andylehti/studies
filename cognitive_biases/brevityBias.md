**Brevity Bias**: The tendency to equate length with irrelevance, leading to the dismissal of transformative insights and a preference for brevity over depth.  

---

The assumption that length equates to irrelevance, resulting in the dismissal of potentially transformative insights that could prevent years of trial-and-error learning or other significant experiences. Often manifesting as the "Too Long; Didn't Read" phenomenon, this bias reflects a preference for brevity over depth. It may stem from impatience, past inconvenience, cognitive impasses, or an overestimation of one’s ability to infer missing details.  

This bias perpetuates misunderstandings, hinders problem-solving, fosters massive assumptions, and undervalues the nuanced reasoning required for complex decision-making. Amplified by Google’s algorithms favoring longer content, it spurred an industry of inflated articles filled with **irrelevant fluff.** As users encountered verbose but shallow material, they began to associate length with irrelevance.  

This phenomenon aligns with Hyperbolic Discounting—the prioritization of smaller, immediate rewards (e.g., simplified summaries or quick opinions) over larger, future rewards (e.g., comprehensive understanding or long-term knowledge accumulation). Rooted in how humans perceive time, this inclination often underestimates the value of sustained effort or delayed gratification. By dismissing detailed learning, intellectual depth and critical thinking wane, fostering a culture that prioritizes surface-level information over substantive expertise.
