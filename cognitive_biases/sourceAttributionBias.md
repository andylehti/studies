**Source Attribution Bias**: Persistently questioning the authenticity of information sources that contradict oneâ€™s beliefs, often due to an unwillingness to reconsider initial views, frequently dismissing evidence as "photoshopped" or generated by AI as a convenient means of rejection. 

---

This bias often occurs in succession, starting with claims that a photo is photoshopped and later attributing video evidence to AI, forming a recurring pattern of streamlined rejection. It is commonly observed among individuals in respective academic fields, respective religions, respective territories, respective communities, and respective belief understandings, who perceive the world through their narrow, respective viewpoints.

Rooted in belief perseverance and confirmation bias, Source Attribution Bias allows individuals to preserve their worldview by invalidating opposing evidence. This serves as a mental shortcut, avoiding the effort required for critical analysis or the emotional labor of confronting potential errors in reasoning.

The bias is exacerbated by the growing sophistication of AI and digital manipulation tools, which provide plausible justifications for skepticism. Ironically, while these technologies increase the possibility of genuine manipulation, they also make it easier for individuals to reject credible information without scrutiny.
