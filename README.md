### Revised Text:  

Research accessibility remains unrestricted, as paywalls are considered unnecessary unless critical for operational sustainability. Humans inherently deserve access to knowledge, and this principle should be upheld universally.  

The following list will be updated periodically. Some DOIs may appear inactive because the associated papers are reserved but not yet uploaded.

### List of Recent Works/Revisions:  

**Polyhedral Index Partition Resources**: Includes the paper, audio, code, and Colab notebook.  
[GitHub Partition Repository](https://github.com/andylehti/Polyhedral-Index-Partition)  

![*Illustration:* Pascal's dimensions follow diagonal paths, while Pascal's laterals take each step along these paths.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/330ca96d-6e0e-474c-9e60-0ac31d042255)

**Research Methodology**: Explains the overlap and nuances of cognitive biases.  
DOI: [10.6084/m9.figshare.27643080](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27643080)  

**Canonical Order of Operations**:  
DOI: [10.6084/m9.figshare.27661734](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27661734)  
This approach differs from the traditional Order of Operations, which introduces subtle but significant errors due to mathematical ambiguity, arbitrariness, and inherent biases.

### Erroneous Investigations:  

After extensive analysis, the following hypotheses were proven incorrect:  

1. **Mass Fraudulent Population Misrepresentation by Roman Catholics**: False.  
   [DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.26547.30243)  
2. **Pi May Astronomically Differ from Reality**: False.  
   [DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.29699.58404)  
3. **Espresso Is the Correct English Spelling for Italian Pressed Coffee**: False.  
   [DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.26827120)  

Though incorrect, these efforts contributed significantly to deeper insights and understanding. Future papers explaining these errors will be published as time permits.
